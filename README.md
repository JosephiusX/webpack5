Initialize projects root directory:

    npm init -y

Install webpack:

    npm i -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server

Create Files:

    touch info.js createElem.js

Next we are going to bundle. 

    npx webpack
      fails with error messages.

    mkdir src
move the 3 files into it. Rename entry.js to index.js
